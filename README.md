# Customer-purchase-prediction-for-personalized-recommendations

This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier to classify customers as high spenders or low spenders based on their purchasing behavior using the Online Retail II dataset. The dataset contains transactional data including the quantity and price of items purchased. In this approach, the data is first cleaned by removing rows with missing values and then a new column, TotalPrice, is created by multiplying Quantity and Price. Customers are classified into two categories: high spenders, those who spend more than the median total amount, and low spenders, those who spend less. The Naive Bayes classifier is implemented from scratch, using Quantity and Price as features for the model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with an 80% training split and a 20% testing split. The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, and the results indicate the model's ability to classify customers effectively. The project requires basic Python libraries such as pandas and numpy to run and can be executed by downloading the dataset and running the provided Python script.
